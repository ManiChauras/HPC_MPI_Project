# MPI Parallel Code for Solving Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation (Gross-Pitaevskii Equation)
### Overview
This repository contains an MPI parallel implementation to solve the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation, specifically addressing the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE). The code initially started as a series implementation and was later adapted for parallel processing with a focus on scalability up to a general number of ranks. Performance comparisons have been conducted between the parallel implementation and the original series code.
### Requirements
• MPI (Message Passing Interface) library.
<br> • Compiler that supports MPI (e.g., mpicc).
<br>• Any additional libraries or tools specified in the code.
